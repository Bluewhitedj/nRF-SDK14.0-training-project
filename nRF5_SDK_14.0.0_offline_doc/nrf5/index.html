*** New features
*****************

** Common **  
 - SoftDevice Handler:
    - Can now register 'state event observers' that are notified when the SoftDevice state changes.
    - Can now register 'request event observers' that are notified when a change of the SoftDevice state is requested.
 - Console:
    - Advanced cooperation with the Logger module (nrf_log). Console can work as a logger backend.
    - Added support for static and dynamic subcommands.
    - Easy-to-use macros for creating commands and subcommands.
    - Added a smart auto-completion feature for commands and subcommands.
    - Added a convenient help handler.
    - Added support for multiline commands.
    - Added support for text edition using the following keys: Left, Right, End, Home, and Insert.
    - Implemented transport layers include: Bluetooth, USB CDC ACM, UART, RTT.

** BLE **
 - Added support the for the latest SoftDevice (S132 v5.0.0).
 - Object Transfer Service added as experimental. The Object Transfer service uses L2CAP Connection Oriented Channels to transfer data between devices.
     - Client implementation added to components\ble\ble_services.
     - Server implementation added to components\ble\ble_services.
     - Central client example application added to examples\ble_central\experimental\ble_ots_c.
     - Peripheral server example application added to examples\ble_peripheral\experimental\ble_app_ots.
 - GATT Service client added as experimental. The GATT Service client is used to receive Service Changed indications from the connected peer.
 - Services featured in the Proximity example are now also accessible as stand-alone service examples.
    - Immediate Alert Service client example application added as experimental.
    - Immediate Alert Service server example application added as experimental.
    - Link Loss Service server example application added as experimental.
 - Added BLE transport Command Line Interface. An example "ble_app_cli" can be found in the 'experimental' folder.
 
** NFC **

 - Added a new pairing mode in the NFC BLE pairing library that supports OOB pairing in both "Secure Connections" and "Legacy" modes.
 - Added flash support in the Writable NDEF Message Example - after the NDEF update operation, the new tag content is stored in flash.
     
** DFU **
 - Added production quality buttonless bootloader with support for bond sharing.
 - Added configurable inactivity timeout timer that automatically resets the device in case no new commands are received before the timeout triggers. Default value is 120 seconds.
 - Added support for USB CDC as a new transport layer for DFU (Experimental, only for nRF52840).
 
** DTM **
 - Added support for new Bluetooth 5 features LE 2M and LE Coded PHY.
 - Added support for nRF52840 devices.
 
** Drivers and libraries **
 - Added a new example that demonstrates strong cryptographic authentication using the Infineon OPTIGA Trust E hardware security module.
    This example uses the following two new libraries located in the 'external' folder: 
     - Infineon OPTIGA Trust E command library that provides a high-level API to access cryptographic and security-related functions.
     - Infineon I2C Protocol Stack library that enables communication with Infineon OPTIGA Trust E and is placed on top of the TWI transaction manager (app_twi).
 - Added Stack guard module that allows for enabling stack violation control.
 - Added Task Manager module, a simple co-operative scheduler. 
 - Added fprintf module that can be used for writing C strings.
 - Added Ring Buffer module that provides functions to manage a ring buffer.
 - Added Memory Object module that allows for creating and managing memory object pools.
 
*** Changes
************
** Common **
 - All examples are modified to use the new SoftDevice Handler (nrf_sdh).
 
** BLE **
 - BLE Connection Parameter module supports multiple peripheral links.
 - BLE ATT MTU example uses nrf_cli for the user interface.

** NFC **
 - Improved the Type 4 Tag library interoperability (added support for fragmented command APDUs and fixed DID field handling).
 - NDEF record and message definition macros are defined as automatic data (used to be static).
  
** DFU **
 - Serial DFU has been updated to be production quality.
 
** Proprietary **
 - ESB: Added workarounds for several anomalies that were impacting performance for certain addresses.
 - ESB: Added functionality to update certain radio parameters while ESB is running:
	- uint32_t nrf_esb_set_retransmit_delay(uint16_t delay);
	- uint32_t nrf_esb_set_retransmit_count(uint16_t count);
	- uint32_t nrf_esb_set_bitrate(nrf_esb_bitrate_t bitrate);
	- uint32_t nrf_esb_reuse_pid(uint8_t pipe); 
 - Gazell: Released in production quality, added workarounds for RADIO anomalies.
 
** Serialization **
 - Added S132 v5.0.0 support. Removed support for S140 5.0.0-2.alpha.
 
** Drivers and libraries **
- Reworked and improved the fstorage library (now called nrf_fstorage).
    - Now supports operation with no SoftDevice.
    - Now supports operation when the SoftDevice is present and its state changes.
- Refactored nrf_log to support multiple backends. Each backend has independent, dynamic filtering of logs.
- Refactored nrf_cli to act as the logger backend. Improved user interface with smart auto-completion and easy commands addition.
- Updated drivers to work with the nRF52810 device.
- Updated Flash data storage (FDS).
    - Can now work with no SoftDevice by using the nrf_fstorage_nvmc backend.
    - The 'Chunk' functionality has been removed.
 
*** Bugfixes
****************
 
** BLE **
 - Fixed a bug where the multiperipheral example would not be able to connect to more than one link.
 
** NFC **
 - Implemented several fixes in Type 2 and Type 4 libraries (fixed nfc_t4t_parameter_set function, removed nRF52 startup code and FPU support from library compilation).
 
** Drivers and libraries **
 - Fixed potential overflow in the watchdog timer (WDT) driver initialization.
 - Fixed wrong header guard in nrf_nvic.h (https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/121041/incorrect-header-guard-in-nrf_nvich/).
 - Fixed a bug where nrf_drv_spi_uninit did not clear an event (https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/116308/spi-init-triggers-old-nrf_spim_event_end).
 - Implemented a fix for nrf_drv_spi - no pulldown on MISO line.
 
*** Known Issues
****************

** Overall **
 - In the UART peripheral example, only a line feed (LF) is output on startup and when resetting the board.
 - Serialized Direct Test Mode does not report RX packet count correctly.

** BLE **
 - It is possible that the Peer Manager may return corrupt data when attempting to read the GATT attributes table under some circumstances when FDS CRC checks are enabled.
 - In the Multiperipheral Example, LED 3 will toggle when writing any non-zero value to it. Also, two notifications instead of one are received on the Button Characteristic (0x1524) when pressing Button 1.
 - For all serialized applications, the MTU size (NRF_SDH_BLE_GATT_MAX_MTU_SIZE in sdk_config.h) should be kept at the default level. Changing this value makes the application non-functional as the connectivity application uses static size buffers.
 - Eddystone Beacon Application - LED indication might differ from what is described in documentation under the Testing section.
 
** ANT **
- Most ANT examples do not have the nrf_log backend in the project files, so enabling logging does not have any effect.
 
** NFC **
 - NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER4 on nRF52832.
 - Some mobile phone apps cannot write Type 4 Tag (the "NFC Tools" app seems to
   be okay to use).
 - BLE peripheral examples with NFC pairing work as expected only with Android 7.1.2.
 
** DFU **
 - Downgrading from nRF5 SDK v14.0.0 to nRF5 SDK v13.0.0 has been observed to cause the v13.0.0 bootloader to corrupt itself (Upgrading works as expected).
 - The S140 SoftDevice currently does not support updating of the bootloader.
 - The CTX pin (P0.07) should be grounded to run the Serial Secure DFU on both nRF52832 and nRF52840 boards.
 - BLE/Serial Secure DFU only supports nrfutil 2.3.0.
 - For nRF52840, a combined SoftDevice and application update on Serial transport fails when using nrfutil 2.3.0. Running a single SoftDevice and application update sequentially works as expected.

 ** USB **
 - USB driver Anomaly 104 solution is very unstable in IAR compilation with high optimization level.
